    # pydantic_core requires compiled Rust binaries unavailable for WebAssembly.
    # NOTE: langsmith is NOT included — it's unused, only a transitive dep of
    # langchain-core. A stub env.py is provided in python_modules/langsmith/.
    # NOTE: langgraph-checkpoint-cloudflare-d1 removed — pulls in sqlalchemy (8MB).
    # Checkpointing is best-effort and disabled when env vars aren't set.
