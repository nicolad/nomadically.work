description: "EU remote classification — real D1 jobs × LLM"

prompts:
  - |
    You are a remote job classifier for EU-based remote positions.
    Given this job posting, determine whether it is a remote job open to
    candidates based in the European Union.

    Return JSON only — no markdown, no explanation outside the JSON:
    {"isRemoteEU": boolean, "confidence": "high"|"medium"|"low", "reason": string}

    Rules:
    - isRemoteEU = true  if the role is remote AND explicitly open to EU residents
    - isRemoteEU = false if it is on-site, US-only remote, or EU-residency unclear
    - confidence = "high" if the posting makes it unambiguous
    - confidence = "medium" if you had to infer from partial signals
    - confidence = "low" if key details are missing or contradictory
